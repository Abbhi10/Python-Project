This project focuses on analyzing match data from the ICC Men's T20 World Cup using Python. It includes exploratory data analysis to understand key trends such as first innings scores, toss decisions, and match outcomes. Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the project visualizes score distributions and team performance. Categorical variables were encoded to prepare the data for deeper analysis, and a correlation heatmap was used to uncover relationships between different features. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and extracting insights â€” key strengths for a Business Analyst role.
